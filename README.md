//Create a website that can do a bunch of things with a pokemon API.

//Reviewer Name: Aiden Foo
//Review: The website looks good, I like the background and the formatting of all the information that is taken from the Pokemon. The Shiny Form button starts as "shiny form" then when I click it, the text stays the same but the image swaps to the shiny form. The button text ends up being what the form of the Pokemon is  which I'm not sure is intended to do that.
Another logic inconsistancy is that the "favorite this pokemon" button. When I favorite a pokemon and go to a new one, the site acts like I still have the pokemon saved, despite it not being in the favorites tab. The only other thing I'll mention is that I couldn't really tell that the white pill in the top left corner was the serach bar, a placeholder for that would help with readability.
The really nitpicky thing I would day is that only the favoriting of the pokemon button is capitalized and no other button is but that's just a me thing. Overall very simple fixes.
Good work
